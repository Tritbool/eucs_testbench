**EUCs logs analyzed to provide real statistics**
> This page aims at providing insight of different EUC performance in real life usage.

## Contributing
If you want to submit some EUC logs, you can do it through [this dedicated form](https://forms.gle/Te37CigvDEXZacGC6)
## Methods
- **Each wheel detailing page contains aggregated data of all logs that are available for this particular wheel.**

- **Each trip is analyzed in detail and linked in a table in the bottom of each wheel's detailing page.**

- So far data must come from **WheelLog** or **EUC World**

## Further data
The more data for different wheels is collected, the more acurate analysis can be.For more acurate information, many trips should be analyzed and results aggregated to provide better insights of real world usafe of those devices.
